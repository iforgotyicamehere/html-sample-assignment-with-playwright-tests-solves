    <h1>Sample Project</h1>
    <p>
      Sucess and Failure are both quite difficult in their own ways. I recently
      decided that i will embrace the difficulty of success and let failure be a
      part of my journey. Each lesson carries its own unique weight and value.
      Thru software development I will explore my best self as well as my worst
      self. I have already embraced the latter :D -iforgotyicamehere-
